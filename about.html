                <p>
                    Hey there, my name is Eddy Peng, and I am currently a sophomore at the University of Washington. I am majoring in Informatics (Human-computer interaction) and minoring in Art history.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Art History has taught me the importance of function in contrast to form. Therefore, I can design simple yet efficient products that make people happy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When I am not designing, I take pictures of clouds and analyze the historical context of my favorite works of art!
                </p>

                    <a href="moreMe.html"><u>Read about my hobbies and interests!</u> 🥰</a>

            <div class="theQuestions">
                <h1>❤️ Why am I passionate about UX?</h1>
                <p>
                    I have always been interested in business, research, psychology, and design. I saw UX Design as a middle ground for all my interests. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I realized that as a UX Designer, public speaking, meeting new people, and collaboration would become the norm. Because I am an introvert, I don't do those things often, which (historically speaking) makes me anxious. So, now is the time to do what I have feared and become stronger!
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="values">
                <h1>😎 My values</h1>

                <h2>Respectfulness towards peers and their ideas</h2>
                <p>
                    Everyone has their perspectives, experiences, and ideas. However, we can't read each other's minds to determine their thoughts. Keeping this in mind, I give other peoples' proposals the time to shine by listening and admiring them for their experiences.
                </p>

                <h2>It's okay to make mistakes</h2>
                <p>
                    We humans often make mistakes since it's in our nature. However, it is okay. Making mistakes allows us to learn, make them part of our experience, and reflect on ways to prevent them from reoccurring later on.
                </p>

                <h2>I have much to learn</h2>
                <p>
                    As a college student, I understand there are areas of expertise where I have little to no knowledge. That will be true for me even after I graduate. With UX design rapidly evolving as a field, there will always be room for growth. By keeping an open mind, I can learn from fellow peers and mentors without the fear of feeling insecure.
